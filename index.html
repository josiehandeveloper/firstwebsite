        <li> I'm interested creating websites that have a minimalistic look to them </li>
        <li> The look is in the details </li>
        <li> I think great website is a marriage between great code and design</li>

        <hr>

        <p> I've always been interested with how websites work. I've had such a great experience making my own website
        on Wordpress that I decided to become a student at Thinkful. Webdesign incorporates different skills that I enjoy 
        technical coding skills along with design components that are interweaved to create the final product.  </p>

        <p> As a student I am open to collaborate with other developers. I am willing to take on any challanges that will help be become
            a better developer. </p>

        <p> Outside of coding, I enjoy spending time in the outdoors and participating in recreational sports. </p>
