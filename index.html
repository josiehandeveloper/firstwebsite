        <li> I'm interested creating websites that have a minimalistic look to them </li>
        <li> The look is in the details </li>
        <li> I think great website is a marriage between great code and design</li>

        <hr>

        <p> I've always been interested in technology from a young age, but didn't really know what I wanted to do career wise </p>
        <p> After dabbling into different majors and odd jobs I decided to take the dip into coding</p>
        
        <p> I've always had an interest in different languages and was intrigued to incorporate these two interests by taking up coding </p>

        <p> I became really interested in coding after I started using Wordpress just as a way to start an online business</p>
